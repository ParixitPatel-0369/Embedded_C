STEP-1: Go inside your project folder

(You already opened CMD inside Embedded_C, so just for understanding)

🔹 What it does:
Moves Command Prompt into the Embedded_C folder
(Git always works inside a folder)

📌 STEP-2: Start Git in this folder
git init


🔹 What it does:

Creates a hidden folder called .git

Tells Git:
👉 “This folder is now a Git project”

No files are saved yet

📌 STEP-3: Check current Git status
git status


🔹 What it does:

Shows which files/folders are:

Untracked (red)

Modified

Ready to commit

First time, everything will be red

Example output meaning:

Untracked files:
  01_Basics/
  02_GPIO/


👉 Git sees them but is NOT saving them yet

📌 STEP-4: Tell Git to track everything
git add .


🔹 What it does:

add = select files to save

. = everything in current folder

Moves files to staging area
(ready to be saved)

📌 STEP-5: Save the project (commit)
git commit -m "Initial Embedded_C project structure"


🔹 What it does:

Takes a snapshot of current folders

Saves it permanently in Git history

-m = message explaining what you saved

Think of it as:
🧠 CTRL + S with memory

📌 STEP-6: Check status again
git status


🔹 What it does:

Confirms everything is saved

You should see:

nothing to commit, working tree clean


✔ Means Git is happy 😊

📌 STEP-7: When you add a NEW project later

Example: you add 03_ADC/01_ADC_Read

Run:

git status        # see new files
git add .         # select new files
git commit -m "Added ADC read project"


🔹 What it does:

Saves only the new changes

Keeps history clean

IMPORTANT CONCEPT (1 minute)

Git → works on your computer (local)

GitHub → website to see code online (web)

👉 To see on web, you must push your project to GitHub once.

STEP-1: Create Repository on GitHub (Web)
🔹 Do this:

Open browser

Go to 👉 https://github.com

Login to your account

Click ➕ (top right) → New repository

🔹 Fill details:

Repository name: Embedded_C

Description: STM32 Embedded C projects

Select Public

❌ Do NOT check README / .gitignore / license
